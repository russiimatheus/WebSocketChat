A description of what security vulnerabilities are in my application:

I've Sanitized user input on the client-side by using textContent to insert message content into the DOM, which helps prevent the execution of malicious scripts and mitigates the risk of XSS attacks. I Used the WebSocket protocol (ws://) for local development and have knowledge about the importance of using wss:// for encrypted data transmission in a production environment. 
	
What I learned from this exercise:

In this assignment I also learned through the readings and researched more about the WebSocket API and how to implement a WebSocket server in Node.js. By having hands-on experience, I solidified my understanding of real-time web communication technologies. Through this experience and research, I've learned and understood the necessity and importance of proper input sanitization even more. It is not just a best practice but an essential component of web application security, protecting against common web vulnerabilities like XSS.
